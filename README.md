ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremy Caceres

- Iâ€™m interested in learning more about AI and game design.
- Iâ€™m currently learning about software design in general, as well as
- looking into JavaScript to further develop my skills in full stack.
  
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on making a roguelike game
  that will be done by me and two other collaborators.
  
- âš¡ Fun fact: NetHack is my favorite game.
