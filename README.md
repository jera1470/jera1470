ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremy Caceres

  Iâ€™m interested in learning more about mobile app and game design. Iâ€™m currently learning to use Android Studio and an introduction with using Jetpack Compose to create android apps. It can definitely help me become better with using native languages to then extend it using frameworks such as Flutter or React Native for cross compatibility.
  
  I'm also looking into JavaScript to further develop my skills in full stack. I have learned HTML/CSS, as well as being rather familiar in C++.
  I just made a new project with a collaborator that simulates Connect Four, having capabilities such as servers and making new clients that can connect to the servers. All of it was done with Java and some CSS.
  
  My current project will be about a roguelike helper of some sort. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on making it with me and two other collaborators in the near future using either Kotlin or C++ in another program (most likely a game). Also, NetHack is my favorite game âš¡, which is also a roguelike.
