ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremy Caceres

  Iâ€™m interested in learning more about AI and game design. Iâ€™m currently learning about software design in general through uses of Java and test suites such as GTest and JUnit, which can enhance my capaibility to test code and release projects, confident enough that they work. And if they don't there is always ways to improve. 
  
  I'm also looking into JavaScript to further develop my skills in full stack. I have learned HTML/CSS, as well as being rather proficient in C++.
  
  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on making a roguelike game that will be done by me and two other collaborators in the near future using either Kotlin or C++. 
  
  âš¡ Fun fact: NetHack is my favorite game. Roguelikes in general are something I like to develop and try out over time. My current project will be about a roguelike.
